Animated Kandinsky -- automated and generative animated graphics, inspired by the paintings of Wassily Kandinsky
Cloud of some relevant concepts:

	"2D evolving graphics"



GraphicComplex :
	null
	| list-of GraphicComplex
	| list-of GraphicPrimitive

GraphicComplex - hierarchy of elements

SceneDescription - hierarchy of all elements in the Scene or Picture

Hierarchy of Movement

Grammar of Layout

Shape, Line, Curve

SystemState, PhaseSpace, Trajectories, Histories
Operations Among SystemStates 
(eg. "sexual reproduction" between two Graphic Complexes)

Strategies (of placement, movement, metachromosis, etc)
Generative Grammars - of movement, placement

Subdivision
Symmetry

Topological properties: connected components, boundaries
	(use of openCV and/or SceneTree analysis to compute these)

Time-series

Probability Distribution Functions
Control Envelopes, Paths
Generators, DataStreams

Parameters, FeatureDescriptor, FeatureExtraction,

FFT
Controllers, degrees-of-freedom

BlendMode
ColourMix  ( modelling of real-world pigment mixture; *not* standard blend-mode
ColourSpace
ColourGenerator

Behaviour

Transform

Metamorphosis - change of shape

MetaChromosis - change of colour

MetaKinesis - change of movement and/or behaviour


Fields, Forces, regions of influence
